I stayed at the [Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Kowloon East](https://www.ihg.com/crowneplaza/hotels/us/en/hong-kong/hkgtk/hoteldetail) in 2015, away from the city center, as I could pay a decent rate for a relatively spacious room. Had a great time at the pool, and the experience at the hotel cemented my preference for the Crowne Plaza chain for a good balance between value and luxury.
