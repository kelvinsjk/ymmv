My first ever foray into the world of hotel rewards program came in 2015 through [Holiday Inn Macau](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/macau/qmpch/hoteldetail)

Having mainly stayed at budget boutique hotels booked off OTAs in the past, the hotel provided great value. The room was great, the hotel is in a good location, and the staff were helpful. I have since been hooked on the rewards program and have even returned to the property in 2017.
